// Welcome to Cypress!
//
// This spec file contains a variety of sample tests
// for a todo list app that are designed to demonstrate
// the power of writing tests in Cypress.
//
// To learn more about how Cypress works and
// what makes it such an awesome testing tool,
// please read our getting started guide:
// https://on.cypress.io/introduction-to-cypress

describe('example to-do app', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Cypress starts out with a blank slate for each test
    // so we must tell it to visit our website with the `cy.visit()` command.
    // Since we want to visit the same URL at the start of all our tests,
    // we include it in our beforeEach function so that it runs before each test
    cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io/todo')
  })

  qase(1,
    it('displays two todo items by default', () => {
      // We use the `cy.get()` command to get all elements that match the selector.
      // Then, we use `should` to assert that there are two matched items,
      // which are the two default items.
      cy.get('.todo-list li').should('have.length', 2)

      // We can go even further and check that the default todos each contain
      // the correct text. We use the `first` and `last` functions
      // to get just the first and last matched elements individually,
      // and then perform an assertion with `should`.
      cy.get('.todo-list li').first().should('have.text', 'Pay electric bill')
      cy.get('.todo-list li').last().should('have.text', 'Walk the dog')

  qase(2,
    it('can add new todo items', () => {
      // We'll store our item text in a variable so we can reuse it
      const newItem = 'Feed the cat'

      // Let's get the input element and use the `type` command to
      // input our new list item. After typing the content of our item,
      // we need to type the enter key as well in order to submit the input.
      // This input has a data-test attribute so we'll use that to select the
      // element in accordance with best practices:
      // https://on.cypress.io/selecting-elements
      cy.get('[data-test=new-todo]').type(`${newItem}{enter}`)

      // Now that we've typed our new item, let's check that it actually was added to the list.
      // Since it's the newest item, it should exist as the last element in the list.
      // In addition, with the two default items, we should have a total of 3 elements in the list.
      // Since assertions yield the element that was asserted on,
      // we can chain both of these assertions together into a single statement.
      cy.get('.todo-list li')
        .should('have.length', 3)
        .last()
        .should('have.text', newItem)
    })
